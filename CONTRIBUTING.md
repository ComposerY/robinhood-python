If you would like to contribute anything:

1. Above anything else, look at the code around where you're contributing and follow the existing patterns.
2. If you would like to improve the existing patterns, do it as a discreet commit and make the changes everywhere.
3. Feel free to contribute to both the base client code and the high level scripts, especially if you want to use them.
